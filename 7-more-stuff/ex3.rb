=begin
Exception handling is a specific process
that deals with errors in a manageable
and predictable way.

I.e., It allows you to prepare for
errors by using the "rescue" keyword -
rescue provides and escape hatch from
errors by giving a default action
when an error is present, rather than
throwing up an error message and exiting
the program.
